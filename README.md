# 3DLIGOSkymap
View LIGO skymaps projected onto 3D celestial sphere!

## Motivation

2D LIGO skymaps are a little bit difficult to physically intepret - at least I think so. 
If you've never seen a LIGO skymap (aka: banana plot), they are essentially 2D projections
of a 3D celestial sphere illustrating how well LIGO was able to localize a given gravitational
wave event.
